# Fixing 404 Errors on Vercel Deployment

If you're experiencing 404 errors when accessing your deployed Feedback Dashboard on Vercel, follow these steps to resolve the issue:

## Common Causes of 404 Errors

1. **Missing index.html in client/build directory**
2. **Incorrect routing configuration in vercel.json**
3. **Build process not generating the necessary files**
4. **Client build directory excluded by .gitignore or .vercelignore**

## Solution Steps

### 1. Ensure index.html exists in client/public directory

The React build process requires an index.html template in the public directory:

```bash
# Check if index.html exists in client/public
Test-Path "client/public/index.html"

# If it doesn't exist, create it with the standard React template
```

### 2. Rebuild the client application

```bash
# Navigate to the client directory
cd client

# Install dependencies if needed
npm install

# Build the client
npm run build

# Verify that index.html was created in the build directory
Test-Path "build/index.html"
```

### 3. Update .gitignore to exclude client/build from being ignored

Add the following to your .gitignore file:

```
# Keep client build directory
!/client/build
```

### 4. Create or update .vercelignore

Create a .vercelignore file in the root directory with the following content:

```
node_modules
.git
.env
.env.local
.env.development
.env.test
.env.production
.vscode
.idea
*.log
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
```

### 5. Verify vercel.json configuration

Ensure your vercel.json has the correct routing configuration:

```json
{
    "version": 2,
    "builds": [
        {
            "src": "server/server.js",
            "use": "@vercel/node",
            "config": {
                "maxLambdaSize": "50mb"
            }
        },
        {
            "src": "client/package.json",
            "use": "@vercel/static-build",
            "config": {
                "distDir": "build",
                "buildCommand": "npm run build"
            }
        }
    ],
    "routes": [
        {
            "src": "/api/health",
            "dest": "/server/server.js",
            "methods": ["GET"]
        },
        {
            "src": "/api/(.*)",
            "dest": "/server/server.js"
        },
        {
            "src": "/static/(.*)",
            "dest": "/client/build/static/$1"
        },
        {
            "src": "/assets/(.*)",
            "dest": "/client/build/assets/$1"
        },
        {
            "handle": "filesystem"
        },
        {
            "src": "/favicon.ico",
            "dest": "/client/build/favicon.ico"
        },
        {
            "src": "/manifest.json",
            "dest": "/client/build/manifest.json"
        },
        {
            "src": "/(.*)",
            "dest": "/client/build/index.html"
        }
    ]
}
```

### 6. Use the deployment helper script

Run the deployment helper script to ensure all necessary files are included in the deployment:

```bash
# Run the deployment helper script
npm run deploy-vercel

# For production deployment
npm run deploy-vercel-prod
```

## Verifying the Fix

After deploying, visit your Vercel deployment URL to verify that the 404 error is resolved. If you're still experiencing issues, check the Vercel deployment logs for any errors.
